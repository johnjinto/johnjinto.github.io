            This app is not about life and death. It is about procastination.<br>
            More often people tent to procastinate things they want to do. This situation falls into the following categories<br><br>
            1. They are attracted to more fun things that give instant gratification<br>
                Thats OK.. beacuse, when a dead line nears, for example an exam date or a client delivery deadline, the fun is replaced with panic. The panic motivates to get the work done. <br>
            2. But in the absence of any deadline, the fun continues without intitiating the action that they really want to pursue. This can lead to regret and suilt feeling later in life.<br>

        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <h4>Life is futile/precious?</h4>
            Some talk about how short the life is... Some say, it is all we have so enjoy the maximum<br><br> Yet other people say, real life is after death, so don't take interest in any of earthly things...

            No. I'm not interessted in a philosophical debate. Again, lets concise it into two bullet points.<br>
              <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
              <li>Life on earth is finite and is mostly limited to two digits.</li>
              <li>Life on earth is so beautiful, we don't need to look the otherway</li>
              <li>If there is an infinite life after death, better be prepared for it</li>
            </ul> 
          

        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
            <h4>So let's box up</h4>
            Irrespective of your philosophical leanings, it makes sense to have a perspective of our life calender, days passed & days ahead <i>(Disclaimer: Creator, preserver and Retractor of life is God alone)</i>.
