            This app is not about life and death. It is about procastination.<br>
            More often people tent to procastinate things they want to do. This situation falls into the following categories<br><br>
            1. They are attracted to more fun things that give instant gratification<br>
                Thats OK.. beacuse, when a dead line nears, for example an exam date or a client delivery deadline, the fun is replaced with panic. The panic motivates to get the work done. <br>
            2. But in the absence of any deadline, the fun continues without intitiating the action that they really want to pursue. This can lead to regret and suilt feeling later in life.<br>

            The contemporary Catholic Church teaches that it is the continuation of the early Christian community established by Jesus, that its bishops are the successors to Jesus's apostles, and the Bishop of Rome, also known as the Pope, is the sole successor to Saint Peter who was appointed by Jesus in the New Testament as ...

           Jesus' childhood home is identified in the gospels of Luke and Matthew as the town of Nazareth in Galilee, where he lived with his family. Although Joseph appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood, no mention is made of him thereafter.[118] His other family members—his mother, Mary, his brothers James, Joses (or Joseph), Judas and Simon and his unnamed sisters—are mentioned in the gospels and other sources.[119][120]

            In Mark, John baptizes Jesus, and as he comes out of the water he sees the Holy Spirit descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God's Son (Mark 1:9-11). This is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus "Son", the other being the Transfiguration.[130][131] The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by Satan (Mark 1:12-13). Jesus then begins his ministry after John's arrest (Mark 1:14). Jesus' baptism in Matthew is similar. Here, before Jesus' baptism, John protests, saying, "I need to be baptized by you" (Matthew 3:14). Jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism "to fulfill all righteousness" (Matthew 3:15). Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness (Matthew 4:3-11). In Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying (Luke 3:21-22). John implicitly recognizes Jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him Luke 7:18–23). Jesus' baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public ministry.[132]
